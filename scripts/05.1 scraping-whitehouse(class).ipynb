    "## 3.2 Parse Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "A parse tree, often referred to as a *parsing tree* or *syntax tree*, represents syntactic constructs in source code or any structured text. It's utilized to portray the code or content's structure in a hierarchical format.\n",
    "\n",
    "For HTML and XML documents, the parse tree denotes the structure of the document. Each tag, attribute, and piece of text stands as a node in this tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Node**: Each unique part of the tree, such as an HTML tag, is termed a node. For instance, in an HTML document like `<title>My Web Page</title>`, both the `<title>` tag and the text \"My Web Page\" are nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Root Node**: This is the highest node in the tree. In the context of an HTML document, the root node is typically represented by the `<html>` tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Child Nodes**: These are nodes that stem from another node. For HTML, tags and content nested within another tag are its child nodes. As an example, in `<body><p>Text</p></body>`, `<p>` is a child node of `<body>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parent Node**: The opposite of child nodes. If node A is a descendant of node B, node B is the progenitor of node A.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sibling Nodes**: These nodes share the same parent. If two tags or textual pieces are housed within the same parent tag, they are acknowledged as siblings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is the Parse Tree Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Navigation**: With the HTML or XML content transformed into a parse tree, navigation becomes possible. This empowers users to discover specific document segments, traverse the structure in various directions, and pull out the desired data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search**: Specific tags, classes, IDs, or other attributes can be located. This capability is a cornerstone in web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modification**: Content can be altered through the parse tree. This includes the addition, removal, or alteration of tags and attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extraction**: Once the desired data is pinpointed, structured extraction becomes feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "Here's some HTML\n",
    "```\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "    <head>\n",
    "        <title>My Web Page</title>\n",
    "    </head>\n",
    "    <body>\n",
    "        <p class=\"intro\">Welcome to my web page!</p>\n",
    "        <p>Here's some more text.</p>\n",
    "    </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Parse Tree Structure:\n",
    "- `<html>` (Root Node)\n",
    "  - `<head>` (Child of `<html>`)\n",
    "    - `<title>` (Child of `<head>`)\n",
    "      - \"My Web Page\" (Text node, child of `<title>`)\n",
    "  - `<body>` (Child of `<html>`, sibling of `<head>`)\n",
    "    - `<p class=\"intro\">` (Child of <body>)\n",
    "      - \"Welcome to my web page!\" (Text node, child of first `<p>`)\n",
    "    - `<p>` (Second `<p>` tag, child of `<body>`, sibling of the first `<p>`)\n",
    "      - \"Here's some more text.\" (Text node, child of second `<p>`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The representation above is a basic idea of how the parse tree would look for the given HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beautiful Soup and the Parse Tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "When Beautiful Soup is employed to dissect an HTML or XML document, it creates an in-memory parse tree from the page source code. This grants the ability to engage with the page's architecture, navigate, seek out, and alter its components. Functions such as \n",
    "- `find()`, \n",
