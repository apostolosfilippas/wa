Here's an overview of the process:\n","\n","1. **WebDriver:** Selenium uses a component called WebDriver, which acts as a bridge between your code and the web browser you want to automate. It is essentially a translator between you and the browser. More accurately, WebDriver is an interface in the Selenium library. Every major web browser has its own specific WebDriver. For example:\n","- ChromeDriver for Google Chrome\n","- GeckoDriver for Mozilla Firefox\n","- EdgeDriver for Microsoft Edge\n","- ... and so on.\n","\n","2. **Coding:** You write code using a programming language (in this case, Python), to tell Selenium what actions to perform. These actions can include opening a web page, clicking buttons, filling out forms, and scraping data.\n","\n","3. **Execution:** When you run your code, it sends instructions to the WebDriver, which then communicates with the web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, etc.) to carry out the actions you coded."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"uytJXSKFCWFQ","metadata":{"id":"uytJXSKFCWFQ"},"source":["---\n","# üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Installing Selenium\n","\n","To be able to use Selenium, you first have to\n","\n","1. **Install selenium in your system.** This can be most easily achieved by opening your command line / terminal and executing the `pip install selenium` command\n","\n","2. **Install webdriver-manager in your system.** This can be most easily achieved by opening your terminal and executing the `pip install webdriver-manager` command.\n","\n","**If you have any problem during the installation, please email the TA**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"635c3863","metadata":{"id":"635c3863"},"source":["Once you have successfully completed the two steps above, it is easy to use selenium, as follows:\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"kDnZgvZxSQg8","metadata":{"id":"kDnZgvZxSQg8"},"outputs":[],"source":["from selenium import webdriver\n","from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service\n","from selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException\n","\n","# create a browser object-- this should open a chrome browser using selenium\n","browser = webdriver.Chrome()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1018db7a","metadata":{"id":"1018db7a"},"source":["If you would like to use a different browser (not chrome), find the correct command below and use it instead:\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"3b458982","metadata":{"id":"3b458982"},"outputs":[],"source":["# browser = webdriver.Firefox()\n","# browser = webdriver.Safari()\n","# browser = webdriver.Edge()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"29b6d1d7","metadata":{"id":"29b6d1d7"},"source":["If you've done everything correctly, a new Chrome window should open!
