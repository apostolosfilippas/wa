    "## 1.2 What's a decision tree?\n",
    "The best way to learn is to read Chapter 3 from \"Data Science for Business\" by Provost and Fawcett. Nevertheless, we'll try to give you a brief overview of decision trees here.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **decision tree**, as the name suggests, can be visualized as a tree structure. It is one of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms and is useful for both classification (categorizing items) and regression (predicting numerical values).\n",
    "- For our purposes, we'll only look at the classification case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components of a Decision Tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Root Node**: This represents the entire dataset. The root node splits into child nodes based on a decision rule.\n",
    "- **Decision Nodes**: Each node represents a question about one feature. For each possible answer to that question, the tree directs us to a child node.\n",
    "- **Leaf Nodes**: These nodes have no children, but instead contain the outcome or the final decision (classification or value). They do not split any further.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How does a Decision Tree work?\n",
    "When we're fitting our data to produce a decision tree, the algorithm goes through the following steps:\n",
    "- **Selection of attribute**: The algorithm attempts to find the most informative feature based on a certain criterion (like entropy, gini impurity, etc.) to make a decision. By informative, we mean that asking a question about this feature should be able to split the dataset well into different classes.\n",
    "- **Decision Making**: Once an attribute is selected, the dataset is split based on the values of this attribute. This process is performed recursively, producing a tree-like model of decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A simple example\n",
    "Let's consider a simple decision-making scenario - deciding if we should play tennis based on weather conditions.\n",
    "- The root node may ask: \"Is it raining?\"\n",
    "    - If 'Yes', the tree might conclude, 'Do not play tennis.' (This becomes a leaf node).\n",
    "    - If 'No', it may lead to a decision node: \"Is the humidity high?\"\n",
    "        - If 'Yes', the tree might conclude, 'Do not play tennis.'\n",
    "        - If 'No', the tree would then conclude, 'Play tennis.'\n",
