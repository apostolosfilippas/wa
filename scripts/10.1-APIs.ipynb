    "# 🚪 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## What's an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of protocols and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. \n",
    "- **It can be thought of as a contract**, where one software promises to provide certain functionalities (through endpoints) in response to a specific set of input parameters.\n",
    "- Think of an API as a menu in a restaurant. The menu provides a list of dishes you can order, along with a description of each dish. When you specify what menu items you want, the restaurant's kitchen does the work and provides you with some finished dishes. You don't know exactly how the restaurant prepares that food, and you don't really need to. \n",
    "- Similarly, an API lists a bunch of operations that developers can use, along with a description of what they do. The developer doesn't necessarily need to know how, for example, an operating system builds and manages a file system; they just need to know that there's an API call that can be used to list files in a directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty much every single command you use can be thought of as an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why are APIs important?\n",
    "APIs play a pivotal role in today's digital world. \n",
    "- They allow for the integration of systems, making it possible for applications to share data and functionalities seamlessly. \n",
    "- They allow for scalability by decoupling server-side functionality from the client side\n",
    "- They allow easy access to third-party tools and functionalities\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing APIs\n",
    "APIs can be \n",
    "1. **Open/Public**: No restrictions to access these types of APIs because they are publicly available. \n",
    "2. **Partner**: These APIs are typically offered to a select number of partners, usually through an agreement. They may require some form of authentication or access key.\n",
    "3. **Internal**: These APIs are usually not exposed to the public. They are used to build internal systems and functionalities."

    "## API Architecture\n",
    "APIs can be classified based on their architecture. The most common types of APIs are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **REST**: Representational State Transfer. REST APIs are the most common type of APIs. They are based on the HTTP protocol and are usually stateless. They are also known as RESTful APIs.\n",
    "2. **GraphQL**: It is a query language for APIs. It is not a standard, meaning that it is not governed by a set of rules and specifications. It is also stateless, meaning that the server does not store information about the client session. It is also cacheable, meaning that the client can store a copy of the response for future use. It is also uniform, meaning that the same API call will always return the same response. Finally, it is layered, meaning that the client does not need to know the internal workings of the server in order to use the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **gRPC**: It is a remote procedure call framework developed by Google. It is based on the HTTP/2 protocol and uses the Protocol Buffers data serialization format. It is a standard, meaning that it is governed by a set of rules and specifications. It is also stateless, meaning that the server does not store information about the client session. It is also cacheable, meaning that the client can store a copy of the response for future use. It is also uniform, meaning that the same API call will always return the same response. Finally, it is layered, meaning that the client does not need to know the internal workings of the server in order to use the API."
